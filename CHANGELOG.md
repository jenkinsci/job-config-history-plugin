Warning

With this version the plugin changes the location where the configuration history data is stored. This means that some data might not be found by the plugin any longer and has to be moved manually. See above for more information.

With the 1.x versions of this plugin, the job configuration history data used to be stored with each job (JENKINS_HOME/jobs/JOBNAME/config-history), whereas the system configuration history was stored in an extra directory under JENKINS_HOME. As of version 2.0, both types of configuration history data are now to be found in one directory under JENKINS_HOME. The default location for this folder is JENKINS_HOME/config-history.
Now there are two possible scenarios:
If you did not use the default root history directory of the 1.x version, but set it to an individual path on the Jenkins configuration page, the 2.x versions of the plugin should still be able to find and display the data correctly.
However, if you did not change the path and used the default root history directory, your job configuration data is stored with each job, where the 2.x versions of the plugin will not find it any longer. If you want the plugin to list the job configuration history again, you have to move the data manually from JENKINS_HOME/jobs/JOBNAME/config-history to JENKINS_HOME/config-history/jobs/JOBNAME.
