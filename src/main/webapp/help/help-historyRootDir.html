The default directory for storing history information is JENKINS_HOME/config-history.
If you want to use a different location, you can enter its path here. <br />
Either an absolute or relative path may be specified.  If a relative path is entered,
it will be created below JENKINS_HOME.  If an absolute path is entered, the value will be used directly. <br />
WARNING: If this path gets changed, already existing history files will not be found by the plugin any longer.
If you still want to have them listed, you must move them manually to the new root history folder.
